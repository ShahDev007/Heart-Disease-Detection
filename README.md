The problem we aim to address with this project is to create a ML model for the early detection of heart disease using machine learning techniques. Heart disease is a 
widespread health issue affecting a significant portion of the population globally. It is important to understand the demographics affected, leading causes, diagnostic
methods, and treatments to fight this condition effectively.

Before, heart disease diagnosis depended on clinical assessments, medical history and diagnostic tests such as electrocardiograms and blood tests. Now this approach may have limitations in early detection and may not use available data for
accurate predictions. Solving this problem with machine learning is really important so that it can provide more accurate and timely predictions, enabling early intervention and
personalized treatment plans. This particular solution will be helping healthcare professionals for patient management and improving total patient outcomes.

Our team’s approach is making a machine learning model which is getting trained on the patient data to predict the likelihood of heart disease. Here, our team’s contribution to this 
project will be the development of an accurate predictive model that can help healthcare professionals in making decisions and improving the care ofpatients.

Then, the summary of our approach involves using some machine learning techniques to make a predictive model for early detection of any heart disease. We will
preprocess the dataset, and perform feature scaling as necessary. Then, we will explore various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors,
perceptron and random forest to train and evaluate models. We will first try to make a model using default parameters and see the accuracy that we attained with it. Then
select hyperparameters for each and every model using cross-validation. Now, using RandomSearchCV and GridSearchCV, best hyperparameters are to be found which shows better accuracy. These trained models are applied to the test set. Our major contribution will be the development of an accurate(nearly) predictive model that can help healthcare professionals check individuals at risk of heart disease.
